The task given by Inkers AI is as follows
1.)Create a simple ReactJS application which shows a simple dashboard after successful login. This dashboard has 2 graphs (bar graph and pie chart) (you can use any graph library of your choice). You need to connect your Charts
2.) with a MySQL server which has [13, 45, 23, 41, 34, 54] for the bar graph and [25, 35, 40] for the pie chart as the data.
3.) For login, login-id would be admin and password would be current date in this format 24march2019. This means password changes based on what date we are checking your assignment on.

The functionality is all done! All thats left is to make minor changes so that it can be uploaded on Heroku!
